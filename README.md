This dataset is a playground for fundamental and technical analysis. It is said that 30% of traffic on stocks is already generated by machines, can trading be fully automated? If not, there is still a lot to learn from historical data.

## Content
Dataset consists of the following files:

 - prices.csv: raw, as-is daily prices. Most of the data span from 2010 to the end of 2016, for companies new on the stock market date range is shorter. There have been approx. 140 stock splits in that time, this set doesn't account for that.

- prices-split-adjusted.csv: same as prices, but there have been added adjustments for splits.

- securities.csv: a general description of each company with the division on sectors.

- fundamentals.csv: metrics extracted from annual SEC 10K fillings (2012-2016), should be enough to derive most of the popular fundamental indicators.
